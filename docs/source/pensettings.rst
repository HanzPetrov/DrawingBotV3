*Created using Sketch Lines PFM & 8 different pens*

DrawingBotV3 supports the creation of multi-layer plots where every layer can have it's own custom **Drawing Pen**.
The current selection of pens is referred to as the **Drawing Set**.

The *Drawing Pens* and *Drawing Set* can be re-configured to experiment with combinations or to accurately match your own collection of pens.

These configurations can be saved as :ref:`presets`

.. _drawing_pen:

Drawing Pen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Each drawing pen has the following settings

**Enabled:** active if the should be used in the current plot, disabling it will make the pen completely inactive not just make it invisible. To view individual pens change "Display: " to "Selected Pen" and then highlight a pen in the table.

**Type:** typically the manufacturers name, or "Special" in the case of **Special Pens**

**Name**: typically the name given to the pen by the manufacturer, or the user defined name

**Colour**: the rgba colour of the pen, which can be customised

**Weight**: dictates how many shapes this specified pen should draw, a higher weight will increase the shapes of geometries the pen draws but decrease the amount other pens will draw, pens with equal weight will draw the same number of lines.

**Stroke**: the pen's width *subject to change* currently this is relative to pixel size rather than actual pen size, unless "Rescale to Pen Width" has been selected.

**%**: not user editable, the percentage of shapes which are being drawn by this pen

**Shape Count**: not user editable, the number of shapes which are being drawn by this pen

.. _drawing_set:

Drawing Set
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A collection of Drawing Pens, note the drawing pens within the set are also saved.


Distribution / Render Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Distribution Type
--------------------
Affects how the shapes in the drawing are divided between all of the pens in the drawing set.
The best choice is chosen by the PFM when it is first run, but it can be changed to create unique styles.

**Even**: All active pens will draw the same amount of shapes, the shapes are divided between pens in the order of the specified *Distribution Order*

**Even Weighted**: All active pens will draw a percentage of shapes relative to their current *weight*, the shapes are divided between pens in the order of the specified *Distribution Order*

**Random**: All active pens will draw the same amount of shapes, the shapes are divided between pens randomly ignores *Distribution Order*

**Random Weighted**: All active pens will draw a percentage of shapes relative to their current *weight*, the shapes are divided between pens randomly ignoring *Distribution Order*

**Preconfigured**: Pens are distributed by the :ref:`Path Finding Module <pfms>`. Used by :ref:`cmyk-separation` and some specialist PFMs.

**Single Pen**: Draw all lines with the first active pen in the list according to the *Distribution Order*

------

Distribution Order
--------------------
Dictates the order in which shapes are distributed between pens, it also has the affect of changing the render order of the pens.

**Darkest First (Default)**: The shapes generated by the :ref:`Path Finding Module <pfms>` will be distributed to the pens from Darkest Pen to Lightest Pen. As the first lines drawn by Sketch PFMs are always the darkest lines in the image this will typically produces the best results and is therefore the default.

**Lightest First**: The reverse of Darkest First, maps the shapes from the Lightest Pen to Darkest Pen

**Displayed**: The shapes generated by the :ref:`Path Finding Module <pfms>` will be distributed to the pens from Top Pen to Bottom Pen in the displayed list. This can create some interesting results where the tonal ranges of the image are mixed.

**Reversed**: The reverse of Displayed, maps the shapes from Bottom Pen to Top Pen in the displayed list.

------

Blend Modes
--------------------
This is purely a rendering option and has no effect on the final plot, it can be used to create more accurate previews in specific circumstances or if you're art will only be digital this can be fun way to play with the colours and blending of lines.

Note: There is a known bug where some blend modes will not be exported properly when rendering an image file.

------

Special Drawing Pens
--------------------
These Drawing Pens provide some unique style for digital only outputs.

**Original Colour**: Di
