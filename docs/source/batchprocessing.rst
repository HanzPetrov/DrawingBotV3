Batch Processing
======================

Allows you to process entire folders of images into line-drawings. This is especially useful when converting image sequences.
Batch Processing will maintain the file names of the original files, but with the new file extension. If you are exporting "per/pen" the files will have the suffixes "_pen1", "_pen2" etc.

All settings like Image Filters / Path Finding Settings / Export Settings / Optimisation will be used.

- **Input Folder:** The source folder for the image filters you wish to process
- **Output Folder:** The destination folder for the processed files.
- **Export Options:** You may select as many File Formats as you wish and export these per/drawing and/or per/pen
- **Overwrite Existing Files:** If enabled when a file output for a specific file already exists in the Output Folder it will not be overwritten, if all file outputs for a specific file already exist it will not be re-processed.
