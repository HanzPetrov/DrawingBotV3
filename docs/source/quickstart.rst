Quick Start

This is a quick guide to creating drawings for Print / Digital Output.

Print Outputs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1) Import the image you wish to draw with **File / Import**, most Image Formats are supported.
2) Open the **Drawing Area** panel and enter the **width / height** you wish to print at in mm
3) Enable **Rescale to Pen Width** and enter the **Pen Width** of the pens you plan to use. This is one of the most important settings for getting good plots by ensuring that lines have the correct spacing to be drawn without overlap.
4) Press **Start Plotting**, you drawing will now be generated.
5) With this first Drawing as a reference you can begin to experiment with the :ref:`pre-processing`, :ref:`Path Finding Controls <pfms>` and :ref:`pen-settings` panels
6) You can export the drawing with **File / Export per/drawing**
